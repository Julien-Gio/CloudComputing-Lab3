# Amazon SQS
Amazon's Simple Queue Service is a message queuing service that can easly scale. You can send, store and receive data between machines without complexity or overhead.
There are two types of message queues in SQS
*Standard queues* are built for maximum throughput. They garantee at-least-once delivery of messages.
*FIFO queues* aim to provide messages exactly once, in the same order that they are sent.
